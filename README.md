# Scala-Category-Theory

[Bartosz Milewski](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/) great book on *Category Theory* implemented in scala, with Property Tests.

# Other resources

There are a great amount of resources on the Bartosz series, here are a few:

- [typelevel/CT\_from\_Programmers.scala](https://github.com/typelevel/CT_from_Programmers.scala/tree/master/src/main/tut): Scala sample code for Bartosz Milewski's CT for Programmers
- [hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf): Bartosz Milewski's 'Category Theory for Programmers' unofficial PDF and LaTeX source

# Why another repository about Bartosz's Category Theory Book?

I just wanted to learn more about Category Theory, so I decided to start reading the book and doing all the proposed exercises. But in addition of just writing t_scala code_, I've implemented **Property test** using `ScalaTest` support for `ScalaCheck`.
